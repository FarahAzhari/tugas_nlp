AI and Creative Arts
AI is increasingly used in creative fields like music, art, and writing. Algorithms can compose music, generate visual artwork, and even write stories, sometimes collaborating with human creators to produce innovative works. This challenges traditional notions of creativity and authorship.

While AI can assist artists by providing new tools and inspiration, it also raises questions about originality and the role of human expression in the creative process.

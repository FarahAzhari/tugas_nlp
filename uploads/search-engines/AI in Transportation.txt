AI in Transportation
AI technology is driving innovation in transportation, particularly with the development of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars use AI to process sensor data and navigate complex environments safely. AI also helps optimize traffic flow in cities by analyzing real-time data to reduce congestion and emissions.

Besides cars, AI is improving public transit systems and logistics by enhancing route planning and maintenance schedules, contributing to more sustainable and efficient transportation networks.

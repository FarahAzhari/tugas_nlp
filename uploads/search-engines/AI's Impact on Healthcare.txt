AI's Impact on Healthcare
AI is revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnostics, treatment plans, and patient monitoring. Advanced AI algorithms can analyze medical images faster and sometimes more accurately than humans, helping doctors detect diseases early. Personalized medicine, driven by AI, tailors treatments to an individual's genetic profile for better outcomes.

AI also supports telemedicine and remote patient care, making healthcare more accessible, especially in underserved areas. However, ethical considerations around data privacy remain a key focus.

How Trees Communicate Through a Hidden Underground Network
Recent scientific studies have revealed that trees arenâ€™t as solitary as they seem. Using a vast underground fungal network nicknamed the "Wood Wide Web," trees can share nutrients, send distress signals, and even support weaker neighbors. This fascinating system highlights the complexity of ecosystems and the interdependence of living organisms.

Older trees, sometimes referred to as "mother trees," often play a central role in these networks. They help younger trees survive by sending them extra nutrients. Understanding this interconnectedness could reshape how we approach forestry and conservation.

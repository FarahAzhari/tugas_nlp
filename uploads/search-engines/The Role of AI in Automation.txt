AI-driven automation is transforming workplaces by taking over repetitive and time-consuming tasks. This allows employees to focus on more strategic and creative activities, boosting overall productivity. In manufacturing, AI-powered robots can perform precision tasks consistently and efficiently.

However, automation also raises concerns about job displacement and the need for workers to acquire new skills. As AI technology evolves, there will be a growing emphasis on human-machine collaboration.

The Surprising Science Behind Why We Love to Be Scared
From haunted houses to horror movies, many people willingly seek out fear for fun. It turns out that being scared—in a controlled environment—triggers a release of adrenaline and endorphins, creating a natural high. This thrill response can be both exciting and strangely comforting, especially when shared with others.

Psychologists suggest that horror experiences allow people to confront fears in a safe way, gaining a sense of control or catharsis. Fear, when not real, can actually make us feel more alive and connected.

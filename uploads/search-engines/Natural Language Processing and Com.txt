Natural Language Processing and Communication
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand and generate human language. This technology powers many applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and real-time translation services, making human-computer interaction more natural.

NLP is also used in analyzing large volumes of text data for insights, such as sentiment analysis in social media or customer feedback, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
